/**
 * Cross-OEM background-execution readiness.
 *
 * Stock Android keeps a foreground service alive with the screen off, but OxygenOS, Samsung
 * One UI, MIUI, ColorOS/Realme etc. aggressively kill apps that aren't exempt from battery
 * optimization — which silently stops the dash stream (the whole point of the app) the moment
 * the screen goes off. The behaviour was device-dependent because nothing here asked for the
 * exemption; this makes it uniform.
 *
 * The `ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` dialog is a standard framework intent and
 * behaves the same on every OEM. The OEM-specific "Autostart" / "Sleeping apps" toggles can't be
 * granted programmatically — only the app's settings page can be opened for the rider to flip them.
